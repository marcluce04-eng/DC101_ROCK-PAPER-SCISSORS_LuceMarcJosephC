Rock-Paper-Scissors: A Classic Hand Game
Rock-Paper-Scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, or Janken in Japan) is a simple, two-player hand game where participants simultaneously choose one of three gestures representing rock (closed fist), paper (flat hand), or scissors (two fingers extended).
 
The rules are straightforward:
 
- Rock crushes scissors → Rock wins
- Scissors cuts paper → Scissors wins
- Paper covers rock → Paper wins
- If both players choose the same gesture, the round is a tie.
